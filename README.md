# Habithub
This is my first GitHub repository! The application helps you track daily habits and improve your routines.

##What is HabitHub?
HabitHub is a simple and powerful Android app that helps you track your habits, stay motivated, and build routines that stick.
With just a few taps, you can log your daily habits, visualize your progress, and watch your consistency grow. Whether it’s reading, coding, working out, or meditating — HabitHub keeps you on track.

##How My Application Works
When you launch the HabitHub app, you’re first greeted with the Home Page, which introduces you to the core idea of building better habits. It includes motivational quotes, an overview of how habits shape our lives, and a daily streak tracker that keeps you inspired.From there, tapping "Get Started Now" takes you to the Habitree screen. Here, you can:
•	Select multiple habits (e.g., Coding, Reading, Meditating).
•	Enter the amount of time (in minutes) you’ve spent on each habit.
•	Log all selected habits at once.
Once you've logged your activities, tapping "Check Your Status" leads you to the Habit Progress Overview.
In this section:
•	A chart compares your habit activity for Today vs. Yesterday.
•	You can view your Weekly Total Time spent on habits.
•	A Summary shows the number of habits logged and the total time spent today.
•	Horizontal bars visualize the time spent on each habit, making your progress easy to understand at a glance.
HabitHub turns your daily routines into visual progress, helping you stay motivated and consistent over time.
